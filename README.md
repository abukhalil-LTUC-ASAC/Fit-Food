# About the Project

Our project is focused on providing the best way to access healthy food for a better life.
Through our recipes application, the user will get several suggestions for delicious recipes within the appropriate calorie limits based on the raw food materials available to the user.

**MVP** : 
1. Provide healthy food recipes based on search and filter tools.
2. Provide the user with caloric calculation service
3. Providing the service of preserving your favorite recipes for later reference
